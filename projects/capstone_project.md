# Capstone Project: Plan and Show a Tiny Automated Journey

Objective: In small teams, plan a kind, effective welcome journey for a school club or event and show how it would work.

2) Journey Map (2–4 steps, including a branch)
3) One drafted email (subject + body outline)
4) A/B test idea (what, why, success number)
5) Ethics note (consent, opt-out, privacy)

Presentation (3–4 minutes)
- Show the brief, walk the journey, explain A/B idea, and share ethics note

Scoring
