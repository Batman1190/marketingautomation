## Lesson 4: Journeys, Personalization, and A/B Testing

Kid intro (ages 9+): We can use a person’s name or interests to make messages feel friendly. We can try two ideas (A and B) to see which one works better.

Duration: 60 minutes

### Learning Objectives (kid-friendly)
- Explain using a name or interest to personalize
- Try an A/B test for a subject line
- Add a decision branch in a journey

### Mini-Lecture (10 min)
Personalization uses known data (first name, interests) to make messages more friendly and helpful. A/B testing compares two versions to see which one works better.

### Activity: Subject Line Showdown (20 min)
Kids create two subject lines and predict the winner. Define success (open rate) and pretend sample size (simulated).

### Journey Branching (20 min)
Add a decision: “If a kid clicked Email 1 → send Event Invite; else → send Tips.”

### Vocabulary
- Personalization Token, Variant, Control, Open Rate, Click Rate
