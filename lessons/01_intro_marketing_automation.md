## Lesson 1: What Is Marketing Automation?

Kid intro (ages 9+): Imagine sending the right note to the right friend at the perfect time—like a birthday message that shows up on their special day. Marketing automation helps grown-ups do that kindly and automatically.

Duration: 45–60 minutes

### Learning Objectives (kid-friendly)
- Tell the difference between doing it yourself vs. letting a computer help
- Spot ways messages can be sent (email, text) and what starts them
- Practice being kind and respectful with messages (ask first!)

### Warm-Up (5 min)
Prompt: “Think of a time you got a message at the perfect time (like a birthday coupon). What started it?”

### Mini-Lecture (10 min)
- Marketing automation sends the right message to the right person at the right time—automatically
- Key parts: people group, trigger (what starts it), message, timing, goal, simple score
- Everyday examples: birthday emails, reminders, club notes after signup

### Interactive Demo (10 min)
Helper shows a simple flow: "When a kid joins the Science Club list → send welcome email → wait 3 days → send calendar."

### Activity: Match the Trigger (15 min)
Kids match scenarios to triggers in the workbook.

### Reflection (5 min)
Exit ticket question: “Why is permission (asking first) important?”

### Vocabulary
- Trigger, Segment (people group), Journey (steps), Opt-in (permission), Unsubscribe (stop)

### Homework (optional)
